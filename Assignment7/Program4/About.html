        Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the Tata Group, opened the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, 
        the first Taj property and the first Taj hotel, on 16 December 1903. The building overlooks 
        the Arabian Sea. He decided to open the grand luxury hotel after an incident involving racial
        discrimination at the Watson's Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel did not 
        permit Indians, who were non-white. Hotels which accepted only European guests were then very
        common across British India. Jamsetji Tata travelled to London, Paris, Berlin and Düsseldorf to 
        arrange for materials and pieces of art, furniture and interior artefacts for his hotel.
        The Taj Group has been active in converting former royal palaces in India into world class 
        luxury hotels such as the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and Umaid 
        Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur. In 1974, the Taj Group opened India's first international five star 
        deluxe beach resort, the Fort Aguada Beach Resort in Goa. The Taj Group also began its business 
        in metropolitan hotels in the 1970s, opening the five-star deluxe hotel Taj Coromandel in Chennai in 1974,
        acquiring an equity interest and operating contract for the Taj President, a business hotel in Mumbai, 
        in 1977, and opening the Taj Mahal Hotel, Delhi in 1978. In 1980, the Taj Group took its first step
        internationally by opening its first hotel outside India, the Taj Sheba Hotel in Sana'a, Yemen and in 
        the late 1980s, acquired interests in the Crown Plaza - James Court, London and 51 Buckingham Gate Luxury
        Suites and Apartments in London. In 1984, the Taj Group acquired under a license agreement each of The Taj West End,
        Bangalore, Taj Connemara, Chennai and Savoy Hotel, Ooty, with which the Taj Group made its foray into Bangalore.       
        With the opening of the five star deluxe hotel Taj Bengal in Kolkata in 1989; the Taj Group became the only hotel 
        chain with a presence in the five major metropolitan cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkatta, Bangalore and Chennai. 
        Concurrently with the expansion of its luxury hotel chain in the major metropolitan cities, the Taj Group also
        expanded its business hotels division in the major metropolitan and large secondary cities in India. During the 1990s,
        the Taj Group continued to expand its geographic and market coverage in India. It developed specialized operations 
        (such as wildlife lodges) and consolidated its position in established markets through the upgrading of existing properties 
        and development of new properties. Taj Kerala Hotels & Resorts Limited was set up in the early 1990s along with the Kerala Tourism.
